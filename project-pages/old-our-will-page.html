                The game is set in a Scandinavian world, embedded deep in Norse mythology and magical beings.

                Some ideas from this system ended up being incorporated into the current system we have now.
                <p>Since our game was gonna have turn-based combat, I looked at many different games from
                    many different eras to try find an interesting an unique mechanic I could focus on. </p>
                <p>I reached the conclusion that very few games allowed the player to controll the order
                    of events in combat, so I came up with a system that did just that.</p>
