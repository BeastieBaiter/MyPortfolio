                    <p>P.I.G.E.O.N. was part of a group of games developed in the early days of my studio, <a href="https://barkingbeaglestudios.com/">Barking Beagle Studios</a>.
                        It was developed over the course of a week with the initial goal of testing team chemistry and development pipelines. 
                        It's a visual novel RPG where you play as a pigeon controlled by an oppressive government to spy on unsuspecting civilians. 
                        The overall experience was designed to be surreal and unsettling, creating a serious social commentary on the limits of government surveillance and 
                        its consequences.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after finishing it, we decided to submit it to a local Portuguese award contest, <a href="https://www.fnac.pt/novostalentos">NTF 25 - Novos Talentos Fnac 2025</a>,
                        where we won first place and a prize of €5,000. This allowed us to develop the game further and release it on
                        <a href="https://barking-beagle-studios.itch.io/pigeon">Itch.io</a> using a "pay what you want" model.</p>
                    <p>Currently, we're working on creating a definitive edition of the game to be released on Steam.</p>
