                  Some ideas from this system ended up being incorporated into the current system we have now.
                  <p>Since our game was gonna have turn-based combat, I looked at many different games from 
                      many different eras to try find an interesting an unique mechanic I could focus on. </p>
                  <p>I reached the conclusion that very few games allowed the player to controll the order
                      of events in combat, so I came up with a system that did just that.</p>
